# Housing_Prices_Regression
Aim : Using a data set from kaggle to focus on data processing and comparing the results given by different algorithms - a multivariate linear regression written from scratch, a linear regression model from sklearn package and a random forest regressor

The main goal of this project is 
i) to learn about processing data before using any model 
ii) implement a multivariate linear regression model from scratch
iii) use a pre-written linear regression model and a Random Forest Regressor model from sklearn package to compare the results

Data Set Used was derived from Kaggle's Housing Price Regulation contest
